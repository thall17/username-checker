## Usage
Visit [https://stormy-peak-29072.herokuapp.com](https://stormy-peak-29072.herokuapp.com), enter a username of your choice and see if it's available on various sites! It may take a little while to load at first as this is a free hosted app on Heroku. Please note that it is a work in progress.

## Development/Contributing
This application was made in part to fill a need.  My hope is that it will help people to use the same username across many different sites that are frequently looked up by potential employers, improving appearance of links on resumes and improving the general UX for recruiters.  I also hoped to learn a few things, namely: regular expressions, HTTP response codes, and the LinedIn API! It's a work in progres so feel free to add more and submit a pull request!

Current sites include:
* Facebook
* GitHub
* Instagram
* StackExchange
* Twitter

Hoping to add:
* LinkedIn
* Many more
